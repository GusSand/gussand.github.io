# About Me

---

I am currently an Industry Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at [New York University's Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/) where I do research and teach in the areas of Machine Learning, Security and Operating Systems.

I am also a PhD Candidate in the ECE Department working with [Siddhart Garg](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/siddharth-garg) and [Brendan Dolan-Gavitt](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/brendan-dolan-gavitt) as my advisors at the Intersection of Machine Learning and Security. I belong to the [Ensure Research Lab](http://wp.nyu.edu/ensure_group/sample-page-2/team/team/).

In a previous life I spent some time in Engineering and Management roles at [Microsoft Corporation](https://www.microsoft.com).
