## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in a hands-on approach to learning computer science. My courses combine theoretical foundations with practical applications, allowing students to develop both conceptual understanding and technical skills needed in the industry and research.

## Office Hours

Office hours are held on Zoom. Please check my NYU Classes page for the current schedule or email me to set up an appointment.
