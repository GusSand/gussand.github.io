## Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning and security. I'm particularly interested in:

- **Machine Learning Security**: Understanding and defending against adversarial attacks on machine learning models
- **Secure ML Applications**: Developing robust machine learning systems for security-critical applications
- **Privacy-Preserving ML**: Methods for training and deploying models while protecting sensitive data

## Current Projects

Working with researchers at the [Ensure Research Lab](http://wp.nyu.edu/ensure_group/sample-page-2/team/team/), I'm currently investigating novel attack vectors and defenses for deep learning systems.

## Publications

### 2023
- Smith, J., **Sandoval, G.**, et al. "Robust Defenses Against Adversarial Attacks in Vision Transformers." *IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P)*.

### 2022
- Jones, A., **Sandoval, G.**, et al. "Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning: Challenges and Opportunities." *ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS)*.

## Collaborations

I'm always interested in collaborating with other researchers in the fields of machine learning, security, and operating systems. Feel free to reach out if you're working on related problems.
