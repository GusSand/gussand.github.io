This course is an introduction to operating system design and implementation. We study operating systems because they are examples of mature and elegant solutions to a complex design problem: safely and efficiently sharing system resources and providing abstractions helpful to applications. 
 
For the processor, memory, and disks, we discuss how the operating system allocates each resource and explore the design and implementation of related abstractions.  We also explore techniques for improving performance and reliability. For example, we discuss scheduling policies for better utilizing the processor, virtual memory techniques for managing memory utilization, and caching techniques for improving disk performance.
 
Programming assignments using both Assembly and the C programming language will provide hands-on experience implementing core operating system components in a realistic development environment. 

We will examine the design and implementation of a UNIX-like operating system in detail and cover general operating systems concepts, such as processes, threads, memory, virtual memory, device drivers, filesystems, scheduling, concurrency, security, and virtualization.
